- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: Built with Vite for quick development and builds
- 🔥 **Global Screenshot Hotkey**: Press `Option+Space` (macOS) to take a screenshot and automatically append it to the chat

## Global Screenshot Feature

The app includes a global hotkey feature that allows you to take screenshots from anywhere on your system and automatically append them to the chat:

- **Hotkey**: `Option+Space` (macOS)
- **How it works**:
  1. Press `Option+Space` from anywhere on your system
  2. The app will hide itself and open the macOS screenshot selection tool
  3. Select the area you want to capture
  4. The screenshot is automatically added to the chat as a new message
  5. You can then ask the AI about the screenshot

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key
- macOS (for global hotkey functionality)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd app
npm install
```

### 2. Get a Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_actual_gemini_api_key_here` with your real Gemini API key.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the React development server and Electron app.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run dist:mac` - Build macOS distribution

## Project Structure

```

## Key Components

- **ChatContainer**: Displays chat messages with auto-scroll
- **ChatInput**: Message input with auto-resize and send functionality
- **ChatMessage**: Individual message display component
- **GeminiService**: Handles AI interactions through Electron IPC

## Architecture

### Security-First Design

This application uses a secure architecture where:

1. **Main Process**: Handles all API calls to Gemini with access to environment variables
2. **Preload Script**: Safely exposes IPC methods to the renderer process
3. **Renderer Process**: React app that communicates with the main process via IPC
4. **Context Isolation**: Prevents direct access to Node.js APIs from the renderer

### API Flow

```
User Input → React Component → IPC Call → Main Process → Gemini API → Response → IPC Response → React Component → UI Update
```

## Features in Detail

### Chat Interface

- Real-time message display
- Auto-scroll to latest messages
- Message timestamps
- Loading states during AI responses
- Error handling and display

### Image Input Support

- **Multiple Upload Methods**:
  - Click the image button to select files from your computer
  - Paste images directly from clipboard (Ctrl/Cmd+V)
  - Drag and drop support for image files
- **Image Preview**: See thumbnails of selected images before sending
- **File Validation**: Automatic validation of file size (max 20MB) and format (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- **Multiple Images**: Upload and send multiple images in a single message
- **Visual AI Chat**: Ask questions about images, get descriptions, or analyze visual content
- **Image Management**: Remove individual images before sending
- **Responsive Display**: Images are properly displayed in chat messages with appropriate sizing

### Streaming Responses

- **Real-time Streaming**: AI responses appear word-by-word as they're generated
- **Visual Indicators**: Typing animations show when AI is responding
- **Smooth UX**: No waiting for complete responses before seeing content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to non-streaming mode if needed
- **Performance**: Faster perceived response times with streaming

### Environment Configuration

- Secure API key storage in environment variables
- API key only accessible in the main process
- No need for manual API key input
- Easy configuration management

### UI/UX

- Responsive design
- Dark/light theme support
- Smooth animations
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)
- Auto-resizing text input

## Environment Variables

| Variable         | Description                | Required |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key | Yes      |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**

   - Make sure you have a valid Gemini API key
   - Check that your `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Verify the environment variable name is `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Check your internet connection
   - Restart the application after adding the API key

2. **App Won't Start**

   - Ensure Node.js is installed (v16+)
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Check console for error messages
   - Make sure the preload script is compiled: `npm run transpile:electron`

3. **Build Issues**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
   - Update dependencies: `npm update`
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation works: `npm run transpile:electron`

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore`
- API keys are only accessible in the main process, not the renderer
- Context isolation prevents unauthorized access to Node.js APIs
- IPC communication is used for secure data exchange between processes
