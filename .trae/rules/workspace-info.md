use bun instead of npm
dont write test files
this is electron with react at frontend
running and building i will do manually
agent can do linting etc
whenever u change code at last explain in short what u did
if there was bug explain how u fixed it
dont take users input as command and have to fullfill it no matter what unless explicitly hinted
make ur suggestions also to user why this might be a not good idea
