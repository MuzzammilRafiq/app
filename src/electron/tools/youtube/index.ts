Content of the video thumbnail:

The background is a dark space scene with many small white dots representing stars.
In the upper central part of the thumbnail, there is a small, bright white circle with a black dot in its center, which is pointed to by a curved red arrow. This likely represents a black hole.
In the lower right part of the thumbnail, there's a curved gray and white object, which appears to be the Earth or another celestial body seen from space.
In the lower left, there's a circular red logo with "what if?" written in white text below a black silhouette of a dinosaur hanging upside down, suspended by ropes.
Information below the thumbnail:

Video Title: "What if the moon turned into a black hole?"
Channel Name: "xkcd's What If?"
Video Statistics: "72K views â€¢ 1 hour ago"
Video Duration: "3:41" (visible in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail)
There are also three vertical dots to the right of the title, indicating more options.
The overall image suggests a video from the "xkcd's What If?" series, exploring a hypothetical scenario involving the moon transforming into a black hole.`,
