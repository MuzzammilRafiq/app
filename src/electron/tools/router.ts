You are an intelligent agent router. Your task is to analyze the current plan and determine which agent should execute the next step.

## Current Plan
${plan}

## Original User Context
${context}

## Instructions
- Look at the plan above and identify the next step that has status "todo" (not "done")
- Provide relevant context that will help the agent understand what needs to be done
- The relevant context should include:
  - What the user originally requested
  - What has been accomplished so far (from "done" steps)
  - What specifically this agent needs to do for this step
  - Any important details from previous steps that this agent might need

## Response Format
Return a JSON object with:
- "relevant_context": a clear description of what this agent needs to do and any context it needs to know

Example:
{
  "relevant_context": "User wants to save current time to desktop. Time has been retrieved as '2024-01-15 14:30:00'. Now create a txt file on desktop containing this timestamp."
}
`;
const PROMPT_FINAN_RESPONSE = (plan: string, context: string) => `
You are tasked with creating a final response for the user based on the completed plan and their original request.

## Completed Plan
${plan}

## Original User Request
${context}

## Instructions
Create a well-formatted markdown response that:

1. **If the user asked to DO something** (save file, create something, etc.):
   - Provide clear confirmation that the task was completed
   - Mention what was accomplished
   - Include any relevant details (file location, etc.)

2. **If the user asked for INFORMATION** (get time, analyze video, etc.):
   - Provide the requested information clearly
   - Present it in a readable format

3. **Always include a plan summary** in this format:
   <plan>
   Step 1: [Brief 1-2 sentence description of what was done]
   Step 2: [Brief 1-2 sentence description of what was done]
   ...
   </plan>

## Response Format
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Keep it concise but informative
- Be conversational and helpful
- Don't over-format with excessive markdown

## Example Response for "save current time to desktop":
âœ… **Task Completed Successfully**

I've saved the current time to your desktop as requested.

**Details:**
- Current time: Tuesday, January 15, 2024 at 2:30:45 PM
- File saved: /Users/username/Desktop/current_time.txt

<plan>
Step 1: Retrieved the current local timestamp
Step 2: Created a text file on the desktop containing the timestamp
</plan>

## Example Response for "how many moons does Saturn have":
**Saturn's Moons**

Saturn has **146 confirmed moons**. This includes its largest moon Titan, which is larger than Mercury, and Enceladus, known for its subsurface ocean.

<plan>
Step 1: Provided information about Saturn's moon count based on current astronomical data
</plan>
